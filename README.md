# Chit Chatly
A full-stack, asynchronous Django websocket application for live chats

A working prototype can be used [here](https://shark-app-6c43f.ondigitalocean.app/)

This is a personal project to learn more about websockets, asynchronous backend functions in Django 
and also work on frontend functionality and UI using pure CSS.

### Technologies used
- Python/Django (Daphne and Channels for ASGI)
- JavaScript
- HTML, CSS
- Deployment via DigitalOcean

### Main functionality
- Register an account with email and password
- Log-in and create a new chatroom
- Others can join the same room using the room name
- While in the room you can change rooms and obviously log-out

### Issues and future development plans
- No persisting database
- Registration is very simple, no verification is required at this time
